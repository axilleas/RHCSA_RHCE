#~#~# Understand and Use Essential Tools #~#~#
_____________________________________________________________________

	Access a shell prompt and issue commands with correct syntax.
_____________________________________________________________________

		Access From Boot via Single User Mode
			- GRUB Spash Screen
				- Press any key to enter the GRUB interactive menu.
				- Select the version of the kernel you would like to boot and type 'a', to append to the line
				- Go to the end of the line and enter 'single'
				- Press 'enter' to exit the edit mode
			- During an X session (GUI)
				- Open a terminal via one of the terminal applications
				- CTRL+FX (F1 - F6)
					- Virtual Teletype Terminal

_____________________________________________________________________

	Use input-output redirection (>, >>, |, 2>, etc.).
_____________________________________________________________________

		Input/Output Redirect Options
			> - Create file, or overwrite file if already existst
					echo 'redirect test 1' > redirectTest
					cat redirectTest
						redirect test 1
					echo 'redirect test 2' > redirectTest
					cat redirectTest
						redirect test 2
			>> - Create file, or append file if already exists
					echo 'redirect test 1' >> redirectTest
					cat redirectTest
						redirect test 1
					echo 'redirect test 2' >> redirectTest
					cat redirectTest
						redirect test 1
						redirect test 2

			| - Uses the output of one command, for the input of another
					[root@RHCE_VM ~]# cat /etc/passwd | grep moe
						moe:x:502:502::/home/moe:/bin/bash

					This example takes the output of 'cat /etc/passwd', which is a list of users on the system, and uses it for input for the grep command, which then locates the user moe and outputs only his line. 

		Two Basic Forms of Output

			Standard Output - Normal output of a command on the screen
					echo 'This is an example of standard output'
						This is an exampl of standard output

			Standard Error - Contains errors that occur when the program runs that do 	  not get sent to standard output
					[root@RHCE_VM ~]# fakeCommand
						-bash: fakeCommand: command not found (<-- This is the Standard Error Output)

			1> - Standard Output to a file, over writes if exists
			2> - Standard Error to a file, over writes if exists
			&> - Both Standard Output, and Error to a file, over writes if exists

			1>>, 2>>, &>> - Same as above, however appends if exists instead of over 	writing

	Use grep and regular expressions to analyze text.
_____________________________________________________________________

		grep - Uses regular expressions
		egrep - Uses extended regular expressions
					This is the same as using: grep -E
		fgrep - Turns off regular expressions, and searches via simple string
					This is the same as using: grep -F

		Regular Expressions

			Nice quick overview, and basic eamples
				http://www.petefreitag.com/cheatsheets/regex/
			
			Basic
				^ - Must be found only in beginning of the line
				. - any char except new line char
				\ - negates special chars such as . or $ 
				$ - must be found at the end of the line 
				[] - any one of the enclosed chars
				* - repition operators, match preceding sub expression 

			Extended
				+ - repitition operator
				? - matches 0 or one occurrence of the preceding char
				| - OR operator
				() - contian a subexpression
				{} - spcifies one or more number of a preceding charv

_____________________________________________________________________

	Access remote systems using ssh and VNC.
_____________________________________________________________________

		ssh - (Secure Shell) terminal remote access
			ports used - 22
			basic syntax - ssh 192.168.1.1
			specified user - user@192.168.1.1
		vnc - (Virtual Network Computing) graphical remote access
			ports used - 5900-590x
			Connect to vncserver via vnc client programs
				Tiger VNC Viewer (vncviewer)
				Vino

	Log in and switch users in multiuser runlevels.
_____________________________________________________________________

	Switch users
		su userName
		su - userName 
			switches to userName
		su
		su -
			switches to root user

	Run Levels
		runlevel - see which runlevel you are currently in

		Levels 
			0 - Halt - Immediately shuts down system and powers off
			1 - Single User - Bare essentials mode for maint
			2 - User-defined - Custom
			3 - Multi-user w/ console only - All services except X11(GUI)
			4 - User-defined - Custom
			5 - Multi-user w/ display and console - All services
			6 - Reboot

		init x - changes run level 

		/etc/rc.d - contains the runlevel definitions
			# ls /etc/rc.d
				init.d  rc0.d  rc2.d  rc4.d  rc6.d     rc.sysinit
				rc      rc1.d  rc3.d  rc5.d  rc.local

_____________________________________________________________________

	Archive, compress, unpack, and uncompress files using tar, star, gzip, and bzip2.
_____________________________________________________________________

	Create large file to test with
		dd if=/dev/urandom of=largefile bs=10M count=1
	Check file size
		ls -liah
			393380 -rw-r--r--.  1 root root  10M Jun 26 03:10 largefile

	Archives - Not compressed 
		tar cvf largefile.tar largefile
			c - create
			v - verbose
			f - file
	
	Compress Archives
		gzip - tar cvzf largefile.tar.gz largefile
		bzip2 - tar cvjf

	Uncompress Archives
		gzip - tar xzvf largefile.tar.gz
		bzip2 - tar xjvf largefile.tbz2

_____________________________________________________________________

	Create and edit text files.
_____________________________________________________________________

	vim testFile
		Creates the file if it does not exists and opens the file in the vim text editor

	Other Text Editors
		vi
		nano

_____________________________________________________________________

	Create, delete, copy, and move files and directories.
_____________________________________________________________________

	New  
		touch newFile
		mkdir newDir
	
	Delete
		File
			rm fileName
		Empty Directory
			rmdir dirName
		Directory w/ Content
			rm -r dirName
		File/Directory w/o Confirmation
			rm -rf testDir

	Copy
		cp fileName1 fileName2
		cp -r copyDir copyDir2
			copies contents of directory recursivly 

	Move - Also used as rename
		mv fileName1 fileName2


_____________________________________________________________________

	Create hard and soft links.
_____________________________________________________________________

	Soft Link - Symbolic Links
		ln -s fileName softLinkFileName
		
			-Indirect link to files
			-If orig file is deleted, soft links will no longer function
			-Can be created across file systems
			-Can link to directories
			-Can link to files that don't actually exist

	Hard Link
		ln fileName hardLinkFileName

			-Direct link to file
			-Contains fileName and the inode number of the file to which it links
			-Any changes made to hard link, are also made to the original file. 
			-Same permission as original file.
			-Even if the original file is deleted, the hard link will still provide access to the data in the file
			-To delete a file completely, you need to delete the file itself, and all the hard links attached to it.

_____________________________________________________________________

List, set, and change standard ugo/rwx permissions.
